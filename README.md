# Exploratory-Data-Analysis

For this project, there are 8 files in this repository: 4 R scripts and 4 png files.

To get the 4 png pictures, one will need to run the 4 corresponding scripts.

For each plot I constructed the plot first and then saved it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and a height of 480 pixels. I named each of the plot files as 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟷.𝚙𝚗𝚐, 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟸.𝚙𝚗𝚐, etc and created a separate R code file (𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟷.𝚁, 𝚙𝚕𝚘𝚝𝟸.𝚁, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot. My code file includes code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced.
